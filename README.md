# Crowdfunding_ETL
project 2 (pistachios) Ruby & Pascale.

# in this project we started by cleaning the data in our crowdfunding.xlsx and created :
.Category and Subcategory DataFrames
.Campaign DataFrame
.Contacts DataFrame.
(ALL FILES EXTRACTED IN RESOURCES FOLDER)

# In quickDBD_files folder we added:
.crowdfunding_db_schema.sql ( wich contains the schema used to create tables on pgadmin.
.quickDBD_ERD.jpeg ( is a screen shot of the (ERD) )

# In ETL_Mini_Project_PGachette_RGhabboun.ipynb :
we have the code we used to clean, extract, and work with the data in order to get the csv files for our tables.

### 3 questions by Keith Ellis :
1) ETL Project Debrief Questions : What are the challenges associated with ETL?
2) What are the benefits of ETL?
3) How might ETL change when moving to the cloud?
 # Answers :

1)  ETL Project Debrief Questions : What are the challenges associated with ETL?
   . The fist challenge is inconsistancy in the data and and the data being unclean and hard to analyze.
   . Figuring out how we want to clean and view the data in multiple dataframes and what values should be extracted in each table.
   . Handeling large amount of data and not consume a big chunk of our time to optimize the process.
   . Identifying and handling errors during the ETL process.
   . Insuring that all the data provided is consistant and free of errors and null values usually takes the longest time ( if present ).

2) What are the benefits of ETL?
   . The ELT process provides a better way to analyze data by making the data easier to read, analyze, draw conclusions, and effecient.
   . it can improve time and productivity for the analysis process without the use of complex and long coding process.
   . more organized and easier to share and split the work between timeframes and co-workers. 


 3) How might ETL change when moving to the cloud?
    . The use of the cloud is goinh to increase efficiency and flexibility by providing On-Demand Resources and data being global and highly adaptable based on work load.
    . High storage options
    . Provides integration services that will also result in more effeciency.
    OVER ALL BETTER AND MORE IFFECIENT ELT PROCESS.
